# Research-SwinTransformer

The main task was to study the Swin-Transformer model.
In the process of studying the architecture of the model, it was interesting to make a comparison with the VIT model, I also explored various optimization methods that could be applied using basic and available tools, instead of developing my own accelerators.

The Swin-Transformer model is a modern transformer-based architecture that provides high performance on image processing tasks.

## Completed tasks
- Learning Swing Architecture
- Exploring ways to fine-tune it
- Exploring ways to accelerate/optimize the model with basic tools
